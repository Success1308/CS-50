#### Description:

The Rock Paper Scissors Game is a simple web application that lets you play the traditional game against a computer opponent. 
The game interface consists of three buttons that depict rock, paper, and scissors, respectively. When a user hits one of these buttons, the game randomly selects one of the three alternatives for the computer, compares it against the user's selection, and judges the winner depending on the game's rules.
